Here, in this page we will discuss the program for Decimal to binary conversion in python. A decimal number is a standard representation of integers or non-integers, decimal numbers are also called as numbers with base 10. Whereas in binary number system numbers are with base 10 and shows representation by 0 and 1.

Decimal to binary conversion

Methods discussed
Method 1: Binary Bits stored in Array
Method 2: Using mathematical operations to generate binary equivalent.
Algorithm  ( Method 1 )
Initialize a empty array as binaryArray
while input number is greater then 0
Append 1 if unit digit of num is odd else append 0
Assign half the value of num to num
Print all the values of  binaryArray
Python Code
Run
def convertBinary(num):
    binaryArray = []
    while num>0:
        binaryArray.append(num%2)
        num = num//2
    for j in binaryArray:
        print(j, end="")


decimal_num = 21
convertBinary(decimal_num)
Output
Binary of 21 is : 10101

------------------------------------------------Algorithm  ( Method 2 )------------------------------------------------
Initialize variables binary, i, rem and assign 0, 1, 0 respectively
While input number is greater then zero run he loop
rem equals to divisibility of input by 2
num equals to half of num
Add rem * i to binary
Multiply i by 10
return binary  


Python Code
Run
def convertBinary(num):
    binary = 0
    i, rem = 1, 0
    while num != 0:
        rem = num % 2
        num = num // 2
        binary += rem * i
        i *= 10
    return binary


decimal_num = 21
print("Binary of", decimal_num, "is : ", end="")
print(convertBinary(decimal_num))
Output
Binary of 21 is : 10101
